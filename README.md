# HabitTracker

A Habit Tracker is a Java-based application where a user can add, track, and update daily habits (e.g., Exercise, Reading, Meditation). Under development, more features to be added soon

🔹 Concepts Used:

✔️ Classes & Objects (OOP)

✔️ Encapsulation (private fields + getters & setters)

✔️ ArrayLists (to store habits)

✔️ File Handling (optional) (to save data)
